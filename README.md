# etch-a-sketch
Project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) for event listeners, flexbox and DOM manipulation. (Both extra credit problems are also done.) There is a grid of size 960px. Users can click a button to specify the number of cells the grid should have for rows and columns (2 to 100 inclusive). The grid is created via flexbox. Every time a mouse is over a cell, the cell becomes more opaque and turns black. Leaving the cell, the cell opacity does not change, but the color is changed to a random RGB color.

It is recommended to visit the site with desktop as the size of the grid is 960px.
